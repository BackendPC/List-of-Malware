We give credit to many Github users who have assembled and created these viruses/malware. We have taken the liberty to compile
many of these repositories so that many of our users can find what they are looking for easily. The following is a list of all
the users and their repositories as used in our company. Our company has made no attempt to rearrange, manipulate, delete or
add any of the original files created by the original implimentors of the repositories they came from.
